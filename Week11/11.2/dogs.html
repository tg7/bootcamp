Make a dogs object with three keys...

First key called "raining" with a value of true

Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs

Make a cats object with three keys...

First key called "raining" with a value of false

Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"

Third key calle "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats

Make the dog bark

Make the cat meow

BONUS: Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the raining keys are equal to true.

BONUS: Look to see if you can find any means to simplify your code further and further
