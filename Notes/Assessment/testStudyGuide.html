Notes for Test

34) JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Using proper syntax, declare an empty anonymous function (no code to execute in the block)that takes in one argument named coolness.

<!-- var todd = function(coolness) {}; -->


35) JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Using proper syntax, declare an empty named function (no code to execute in the block) with the name beAwesome that takes in one argument named awesomeSauce.

<!-- function beAwesome(awesomeSauce) {} beAwesome(); -->

36. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Using proper syntax, declare an empty anonymous function expression with a variable named beAwesomer that takes in one argument named awesomerSauce.

<!-- var beAwesomer = function(awesomerSauce) {} -->

37. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Using proper VanillaJS syntax, write the most widely supported function that loads the script(s) after all DOM elements and media content (pictures, videos, etc.) have been loaded:

<!-- window.onload = function() {}; -->

38. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Using proper jQuery syntax, write the function that you would put at the beginning of a Javascript file to load the script after just the DOM elements have loaded on the web page:

<!-- $(document).ready(function() {}); -->

39. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Why is $(document).ready() better than window.onload?

<!-- Option C -->

40. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Create an array called myCoolArray with four string elements of your choosing.

<!-- var myCoolArray = ["Sports", "Animals", "Snowboarding", "Coding"]; -->

41. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Write out how you would access the third element in the array from the previous question you created in the previous question.

<!-- console.log(myCoolArray[2]); -->

42. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Create an object called myObject with four properties:
- myName property with a string value of your name,
- myBirthdayMonth property with a string value of your birth month,
- myAlertFunc property whose value is a function that takes in one argument (string type) and invokes an alert with the
argument text in it
- myAdditionFunc property whose value is a function that takes in two arguments (integer type), adds those two arguments, then returns the sum/answer).

<!-- var myObject =  {

  myName: "Todd",
  myBirthdayMonth: "December", 

  myAlertFunc: function(string_type) {
    alert(string_type);
    return(string_type); 
    },

  myAdditionFunc: function(integer, type) {
    return (integer) + (type);
    },

}; -->

43. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Using the object that was just created, output the values of the four object properties to the
browser console using console.log and dot notation.

<!-- console.log(myObject.myName);
console.log(myObject.myBirthdayMonth);
console.log(myObject.myAlertFunc("hello there"));
console.log(myObject.myAdditionFunc(3,4)); -->

<h2></h2>
44. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Given the following array of objects in the image above, write out the syntax using dot notation
to access the second element in the array and print out all of its properties:

45. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Given the array and if-else conditional above, what would be printed out to the console?

46. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Given the switch-case statement above, what would be printed to the console?

47. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - What boolean value does 2 === "2" evaluate to?

<!-- false -->

2 is 
48. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - What boolean value does 3 !== 3 evaluate to?

<!-- true -->

<h3></h3>
49. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Given the array and ternary if-else conditional above, what would be printed to the console?

50. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - What would 2 + 5 evaluate to?

51. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - What would 200 - 100 evaluate to?

52. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - What would 10 * 50 evaluate to?

53. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - What would 60 / 12 evaluate to?

54. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - What would 22 % 10 evaluate to?

55. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Given the following scenario above, what would be printed to the console?

56. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Given the scenario above, what would be printed to the console?

57. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Given the following for loop:

<!-- for (var k = 0; k < jedi.length; k++)  -->

58. 

<!-- document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener("click", test)

function test() {
alert("Hello World!");
  }; -->

59.

<!-- $('#myButton').on("click", function() {

  alert("Hello World!")

}); -->

60. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Traversing the DOM with VanillaJS: Given elements on the DOM with class="images", write out how you would select those elements with VanillaJS and assign it to a variable named elementz.

<!-- var elementz = document.getElementsByClassName('images'); -->

61. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Traversing the DOM with VanillaJS: Given an element on the DOM with an id="menu-slider", write out how you would select that element with VanillaJS and assign it to a variable named coolSlider.

<!-- var coolSlider = document.getElementById('menu-slider'); -->

62. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Traversing the DOM with jQuery: Given an element on the DOM with class="article-section", write out how you would get all the elements contained within it.

<!-- $('.article-section').children().css( "border", "3px solid red" ); -->

63. JAVASCRIPT BASICS - Traversing the DOM with jQuery: Given an element on the DOM with an id="win-count", write out how you would get the single p tag contained within it if you don't know where it's positioned within it.

<!-- $('#win-count').find("p").css( "background-color", "red" ); -->

68. APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE - CONSUMING - Using jQuery to make an ajax call to the Github API to
retrieve data, fill in the blank: (Read blank lines left to right, top-down).

<!-- $.ajax({

  method: "GET",
  url: 'http://api.github.com/username/repos'

});

.done(function(data, status, jqXHR) {

});

.done(function(jqXHR, status, error) {

}); -->
