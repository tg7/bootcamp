When creating programs that deal with databases, there is a rather fun acronym which a lot of programmers use in order to remind themselves which functions they have available to them. This acronym is C.R.U.D
C - CREATE - INSERT INTO pets (name, type, age) VALUES ('fido', 'dog', 3);
R - READ   - SELECT * FROM pets;
U - UDPATE - UPDATE pets SET name='under dog' WHERE type = 'dog';
D - DELETE - DELETE FROM pets WHERE type = 'mouse';
