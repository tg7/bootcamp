What is an algorithm?

1) An algorithm is a set of calculated formulas or mathematics to follow a certain specification performed by a computer

What are some examples of computer science algorithms?

2) Recursive Algorithm 
   Insertion Sort

How do you compare one algorithm to the other based on efficiency?

3) Comparing them using Big O notation


<script type="text/javascript">

var sortedNumbers = [1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 16, 16, 18, 20, 25, 60]

var checkFunc = function(number) {
  var containsNumber = false;
  for (i=0; i < sortedNumbers.length; i++) {
    console.log(sortedNumbers[i]);
    if (sortedNumbers[i] == number ) {
      containsNumber = true;
      break;
    } else {
      containsNumber = false;
    };
  };
  console.log(containsNumber);
}


checkFunc(3);
